**Relax NG compact** provides syntax highlighting and autocompletion for the [compact syntax](https://relaxng.org/compact) of the [RELAX NG XML schema language](https://relaxng.org). Compact syntax schemas usually use an `.rnc` file extension. The XML-based syntax in `.rng` files is handled by Nova's standard XML mode.

Current features:

- Syntax highlighting for `.rnc` files.
- Autocompletion for keywords, built-in XSD datatypes, and grammar definitions.

At the moment, annotations are not supported.
